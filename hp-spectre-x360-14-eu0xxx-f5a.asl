    // Issue is caused by _SB.PC00.IC03 device which is declared in one of SSDTs and comes first during name evaluation.
    // Providing a shorter path to the correct value by declaring it right inside I2C3 solves the issue.

    // RP10.PXSX looks like it was initially supposed to be a storage device and wasn't updated after the port repurpose.
    // Power source pin PWRG{S3PG, S3PP} is zero and reset pin RSTG{S3RG, S3RP} (0x140414) is readonly so device is
    // neither powered down nor reset during D3cold transitions causing LTSSM to fail establishing PCIE link.
    //
    // Proper solution is to find real power and reset pins but it's not feasible until schematics/boardview is leaked.
    // For now 'good enough' solution is to just disable D3cold and go with D3hot.
